# Story 9.3: Live Tools -- Ping

> **Epic:** 9 - Alerts, Firmware & Observability

> **Points:** 3
> **Type:** Backend/Python
> **Agent:** @dev
> **Depends on:** None (independent)

## Status

**Draft**

## Story

**As a** network engineer,
**I want** to run ping tests from Meraki devices,
**so that** I can diagnose connectivity issues without SSH access.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `create_ping` initiates a ping from a device to a target IP/hostname
2. `get_ping_result` polls for results (async operation with retry)
3. Results include loss%, min/avg/max latency
4. Supports specifying source interface and count
5. Natural language: "ping 8.8.8.8 from switch SW01" works

---

## Scope

| Layer | New Items | Details |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `api.py` | 2 methods | `create_ping`, `get_ping_result` |
| `agent_tools.py` | 2 schemas | network-analyst tools |
| Safety | SAFE | Read-only diagnostic |

---

## Implementation Pattern

This story follows a simplified implementation pattern (no discovery or config functions):
1. `api.py` — Add SDK wrapper methods with `@log_api_call` (async polling pattern)
2. `agent_router.py` — Register in `FUNCTION_REGISTRY`
3. `agent_tools.py` — Add tool schemas + TOOL_SAFETY classification
4. `safety.py` — Register in `SAFETY_CLASSIFICATION`
5. `tests/` — Add comprehensive tests

**Note:** Both `SAFETY_CLASSIFICATION` (safety.py) and `TOOL_SAFETY` (agent_tools.py) must be updated. No discovery.py or config.py changes needed for this story.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add api.py methods (`create_ping`, `get_ping_result`) with async polling and retry
- [ ] Register in FUNCTION_REGISTRY (agent_router.py)
- [ ] Add tool schemas to agent_tools.py (2 schemas for network-analyst)
- [ ] Register safety classifications in safety.py and agent_tools.py (SAFE)
- [ ] Add tests (target: >= 90% coverage)
- [ ] Verify all schemas pass validate_tool_schema()
